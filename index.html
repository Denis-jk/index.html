        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <p>
            A world where every woman and girl lives free from fear, violence, and discrimination ‚Äî with equal opportunity, dignity, and voice.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
            To educate, empower, and engage individuals and communities to eliminate gender-based violence and promote gender equality through awareness, advocacy, and support.
        </p>

        <h2>Gender-Based Violence</h2>
        <p>
            Gender-based violence is a serious issue affecting millions of women and girls around the world. It includes physical, emotional, and psychological harm caused due to gender inequality.
        </p>

        <p>
            Most cases happen at home, often out of fear, pressure, or control from a partner or family member. Every girl and woman has the right to live in safety, make decisions about her life, and speak out against abuse.
        </p>

        <p>
            As a woman, you must know your rights and responsibilities in society. Most gender-based violence (GBV) happens in homes where the woman is not educated.
        </p>

        <p>
            Many girls are denied education and married off for money, forced into relationships where they are mistreated. This mindset needs to change.

        <h3>üî¥ Causes of Gender-Based Violence</h3>
        <p>1. Gender Inequality ‚Äì When men are seen as more powerful than women, it leads to control and abuse.</p>
        <p>2. Cultural Beliefs ‚Äì Some traditions silence women or promote early marriages and female genital mutilation.</p>
        <p>3. Lack of Education ‚Äì Those without knowledge may tolerate or accept violence as normal.</p>
        <p>4. Poverty ‚Äì Women may stay in abusive homes because they depend on men financially.</p>
        <p>5. Substance Abuse ‚Äì Alcohol and drugs often escalate violent behavior.</p>
        <p>6. Weak Laws ‚Äì Without strong legal enforcement, abusers go free and victims suffer.</p>
        <p>7. Fear and Silence ‚Äì Victims stay quiet due to fear of blame or not being believed.</p>
        <p>8. Family Upbringing ‚Äì Violence learned in childhood is repeated in adulthood.</p>
        <p>9. Peer Influence ‚Äì Friends or social media may encourage dominance or toxic masculinity.</p>

        <h3>üü¢ Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
            Ending GBV requires education, awareness, equality, and community support to build a safer world for all.
